# projet_numerique
This repository contains the code(s) I wrote for a project I had in undegrad, where I tried to model the trajectory of an object around a planet.  

This is just the beginning of the project, I am currently working on a GUI with Tkinter and a database using sqlite to improve it. One major improvement would be to add a second planet, and maybe to take into account some maneuvers.
